# Voidwalker
​
Voidwalker is a text-based, choose-your-adventure game. You will progress through a dream-like world where your decisions
decide your path. This version is just a demo and updates may be added later. 
​
​
- FEATURE 1: Implement a master loop. This is accomplished with the 'GameOver' method in which if the player dies or chooses wrong
an end screen will appear giving the player the choice to either restart or exit the game.

​
- FEATURE 2: Create a list or array and pull data to be used in the program. This is accomplished with the 'PlayerList' and the
'PartOne' array. 'PlayerList' holds all items the player will acquire and it is checked for these items at certain points to determine
if the player may continue. The 'PartOne' array contains all story text related to certain paths the player may take in Part One of
the game.

 ​
- FEATURE 3: Create a class that inherits from a parent class. This is accomplished with the Weapon class inheriting from the Item class.
